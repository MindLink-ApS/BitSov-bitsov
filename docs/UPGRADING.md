# Upgrading a retained node

This note covers two common failure modes when replacing the `konsensus` binary on a
production data directory without re-running `konsensus init`.

## Missing `NODE_INITIALIZED` after upgrade (pre-#76/#77 nodes)

Nodes deployed before bootstrap (#76/#77) never wrote a `NODE_INITIALIZED` marker. After
upgrading the binary, `konsensus start` refuses with reason
`identity_and_state_without_marker`: identity material and wallet/channel state are present,
but the marker is absent.

This is expected for a healthy legacy installation — not a signal to wipe the data directory.
Finish the one-time marker write (the node will **not** do this automatically):

```bash
konsensus repair mark-initialized --config /path/to/konsensus.toml --confirm
```

Use the same config path you pass to `konsensus start` (`-c` / `--config`). The repair
writes `NODE_INITIALIZED` and nothing else, then normal startup proceeds.

See also [pairing security](security/pairing.md) for how the marker fits into bootstrap.

## Stale `KONSENSUS_SQLITE_MIGRATIONS_DIR`

Released binaries embed the full SQLite migration set. You normally **do not** need
`KONSENSUS_SQLITE_MIGRATIONS_DIR` on a production host.

If a systemd unit or shell profile still sets it to an **old on-disk migrations tree**
(from a July build, for example), the new binary may start against a database that never
receives migrations 020–025. That produces recurring storage errors (for example outbox
reconciliation failures) instead of a clean refusal.

From current releases, startup **fails closed** when the directory is missing any migration
version embedded in the binary. The error names the directory and the missing version numbers.

**Fix:**

1. Remove `KONSENSUS_SQLITE_MIGRATIONS_DIR` from the unit/environment so embedded migrations
   apply, **or**
2. Point it at a directory that includes **every** migration version the binary embeds (extra
   files are fine; the directory must be a superset).

After fixing the migrations source, restart the node. The node applies any pending schema
migrations itself on first open before serving traffic.
