# Open calls by peer

`GET /api/v1/calls?peer=<node-id>` is an owner-scoped, read-only view of the
node's durable call state. It requires a valid owner-subject bearer token with
`read` scope (including an owner's paired app with that scope). Missing or
invalid authentication returns 401; a different subject or missing scope
returns 403.

`peer` is required and must decode as a 32-byte hex node id. Missing, duplicate,
or malformed peer parameters return HTTP 400 with fixed JSON error text:
`{"error":"invalid peer id"}`. Input is never echoed. A valid
unknown peer returns `[]`.

The response is an array of at most **4** entries (the per-peer open-call
admission bound), with unresolved reservations first, then call id order.
The bound also applies if the stored data exceeds the admission bound.

```json
[
  {
    "id": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    "state": "ended",
    "direction": "outgoing",
    "unresolved_paid_admission": true,
    "created": 1790000000000,
    "op_id": "9a6b9c52-f45b-400d-8891-080fb382dcad"
  }
]
```

- `id`: the call id, scoped to the requested peer.
- `state`: `reserved`, `ringing`, `live`, or `ended`, aged at read time.
- `direction`: `outgoing` (this node offered) or `incoming` (the peer offered).
- `unresolved_paid_admission`: boolean; conservatively true whenever the call
  retains a pending signal reservation. The read does not reconcile payment
  evidence or release reservations, even when a journal appears terminal.
- `created`: nullable integer, Unix milliseconds. When a pending offer is bound
  to a matching operation journal entry, this is that operation's stored
  `created_at`. Otherwise it is `null`: `call_state` has no creation timestamp,
  and an answer/hangup timestamp is not the call's creation time.
- `op_id`: nullable string, the stored pending signal's operation id, or `null`
  once no operation binding remains in call state. It can refer to an answer
  or hangup rather than an offer. No placeholder strings are returned.

Open means an unexpired reserved/ringing/live call **or any call with a pending
signal**, including calls whose ringing/live deadline and replay tombstone
have expired. Ended/expired calls without a pending signal are omitted.

**The client must fail closed per peer when `unresolved_paid_admission` is
true:** keep blocking re-admission/new paid admission to that peer, even if
`state` is `ended` or metadata is `null`. Expiry does not prove nonpayment.
Only normal operation recovery/settlement can resolve the reservation; GET
never does so. This blocker applies to the requested peer, not unrelated
peers. An empty response is a snapshot, not authorization to bypass the normal
compose/admission checks.

The endpoint uses existing tables without a migration. It does not request
prices, pay, dispatch signals, emit call events, sweep rows, or mutate the
operation journal. See [call protocol and recovery](CALLS-PROTOTYPE.md).
