## [0.3.0-rc8] — 2026-09-29 (prep; not tagged yet)

**Pre-release.** Not for production use. Source range: `v0.3.0-rc7` (`958e399`) →
this branch tip on `main`. Full narrative: [`docs/releases/v0.3.0-rc8.md`](docs/releases/v0.3.0-rc8.md).
Retained-node upgrade: [`docs/UPGRADING.md`](docs/UPGRADING.md).

### Payments safety
- Proven `PaymentNotDispatched` survives API conversion as `400` / `not_dispatched` across pay, keysend, open-channel, send-onchain, and related paths (#115, #117).
- Lightning spend caps cover principal **and** routing fees (#99); node-enforced paid-send caps (#80); capped re-admission refuses with a stable reason (#121).
- Incomplete paid recovery fails closed to `payment_unknown` (#119); paid resends back off while the peer is offline (#118); outbox scans are bounded and keep replay tombstones (#116).
- Paid envelopes are retained until atomic acceptance ACK (#103); channel fee/announcement requests are enforced (#101).

### Exactly-once
- Compose operations persist for exactly-once delivery (#113).
- Event-driven payment settlement cuts real-LDK first contact from ~4.2 s to ~0.55 s (#108).
- Instant paid first contact / payer-side reply acceptance (#102, #100); reconnect re-proves admission (#86).

### Readiness
- Local services stay available while Lightning recovers (BOOT-2) (#107).
- LDK startup fee fetch retries with bounded backoff (#98).
- BitSov-Data-As-Of / Data-Stale on pinned reads (#78, #79, #84); node energy (N1) and membrane events (N2) (#82, #96, #97).

### Upgrade path
- Fail closed when `KONSENSUS_SQLITE_MIGRATIONS_DIR` omits embedded migration versions (#120).
- Document `NODE_INITIALIZED` repair for pre-#76/#77 retained nodes (`konsensus repair mark-initialized`) (#120, #76/#77).
- Pairing, identity-free bootstrap, owner CLI, and scoped tokens (#72/#73, #76/#77, #92, #94).

### Dependencies
- Workspace crate version set to `0.3.0-rc8` (was `0.1.0` for earlier RCs).
- `base64` 0.23.1 (#46), `mockall` 0.15.0 (#47), rust minor/patch group (#88).
- Prior rc7 TLS fix (rustls 0.23.45 / RUSTSEC-2026-0285) remains in the line of descent (#70).

### Also since rc7 (product surface)
- Budget-scoped spend grants (G1) (#81); first contact under a budget grant (#85); F1 capped first contact (#83).
- Signed introductions + capped sponsor kit (K1) (#89, #91); LSPS2 funding pilot (#87).
