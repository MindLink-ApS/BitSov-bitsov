# Contributing

BitSov is a sovereign protocol project. Contributions must preserve the
load-bearing commitments in `CHARTER.md`.

## Non-Negotiable Boundary

Do not submit changes that introduce:

- operator-held user mnemonics or device signing keys
- key escrow or custodial recovery
- operator-decryptable message plaintext
- operator-issued user payment proofs
- hidden dependency on MindLink infrastructure for protocol correctness

Commercial vendor code, live infrastructure, billing, customer data, strategy,
and deploy inventories belong outside the open core.

## Pull Requests

- Keep protocol changes small and reviewable.
- Include tests for payment-gate, storage-wrapper, and encrypted-storage paths
  when touching those boundaries.
- Prefer config-gated behavior that defaults off for relay/operator roles.
- Public issues must not contain secrets, live node IDs, customer names, channel
  balances, txids, internal IPs, or unreleased security details.

## Security Reports

Use private security disclosure channels. Do not open a public issue for a
suspected vulnerability until maintainers have triaged and published an advisory.
